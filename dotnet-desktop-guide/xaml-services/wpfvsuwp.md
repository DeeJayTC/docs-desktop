# Overview of WPF & UWP Differences

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) supports XAML for UI, as does Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Both app frameworks support similar but different implementations of XAML. This article describes the differences between those two implementations of XAML.

These sections list the main differences (primarily from a XAML viewpoint) between UWP and WPF.

The following symbols are used the tables:

* ✔️ Indicates the platform (defined by the WPF or UWP column) has the feature.
* ❌ Indicates the feature is generally missing in the platform.
* ⚡ Indicates the feature is only partially implemented compared to other platforms.

|--------------------------------------------|-----|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x:Array` Extension                        | ✔️ | ❌   | `x:Array` isn't supported in UWP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `x:Bind` Extension                         | ❌  | ✔️  | The `x:Bind` markup extension has become a powerful feature of UWP over WPF. Compiled function bindings can be used for nearly anything and can replace other missing features like <xref:System.Windows.Data.MultiBinding> in most situations. `x:Bind` isn't supported in control templates. Other advantages of `x:Bind` include debugging support and increased performance because it's compiled. |
| `x:Load` Attribute                         | ❌  | ✔️  | You can use `x:Load` to optimize the startup, visual tree creation, and memory usage of your XAML app. Using `x:Load` has a similar visual effect to <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Visibility>, except that when the element isn't loaded, its memory is released. Internally a small placeholder is used to mark its place in the visual tree until the element is loaded.                                                                                                                     |
| `x:Static` Extension                       | ✔️ | ❌   | The `x:Static` markup extension isn't implemented in UWP. In WPF this is used to access a static by-value code entity (constant, property, field, or enum).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `x:Type` Extension                         | ✔️ | ❌   | The `x:Type` markup extension isn't implemented in UWP. In WPF this is used to get a type similar to `Type.GetType()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `x:TypeArguments` Directive                | ✔️ | ❌   | The `x:TypeArguments` directive isn't implemented in UWP, which causes problems with generic type parameters. To work around this in UWP, create a non-generic class that inherits from the generic class and provides the type parameters. Then, use the derived class in the XAML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `x:Uid` Directive, *resw* for localization | ⚡  | ✔️  | `x:Uid` exists in both WPF and UWP. However, using it to localize properties is quite a bit more complex in WPF (using *LocBaml* and *csv* files, with command line tools). UWP provides a much more integrated localization system using `x:Uid` and *resw* files similar to what existed in Windows Forms. WPF is missing this type of localization support and this is a clear advantage of UWP.                         |
| `{DynamicResource}` Extension              | ✔️ | ❌   | The dynamic resource markup extension that is fairly common in WPF, doesn't exist in UWP. A partial work-around requires custom markup extensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Full Markup Extension                      | ✔️ | ❌   | UWP only implements a subset of the full markup extension support in WPF. This area needs to be expanded upon in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Binding & dependency property system

| Item                                | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------|-----|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Coercion                            | ✔️ | ❌   | Coercion of dependency properties isn't supported in UWP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Data (input) validation.             | ✔️ | ❌   | The entire WPF data validation system, including the classes/interfaces: <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ValidationRule> (and all standard implementations), <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.ValidationRules?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.ComponentModel.IDataErrorInfo>, <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyDataErrorInfo>, <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.ValidatesOnNotifyDataErrors%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, isn't implemented in UWP. This will be added in WinUI 3.0 but the story for using this within the UWP app model with WinUI 3.0 is less clear. |
| <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingMode.OneWayToSource?displayProperty=nameWithType> | ✔️ | ❌   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Binding to <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.ConverterParameter>.       | ✔️ | ❌   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <xref:System.Windows.Data.MultiBinding>, <xref:System.Windows.Data.IMultiValueConverter> | ✔️ | ❌   | Useful feature in WPF for advanced binding scenarios no longer exists for UWP. UWP does have function binding with `x:Bind` though (Used to re-implement converter logic).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand>                            | ✔️ | ⚡   | While the interface technically exists in UWP, `ICommand` is nothing like what it is in WPF. The developer is responsible for implementing all parts of the command, however, this was improved in Windows 10 version 1809 by adding <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Input.XamlUICommand> and <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Input.StandardUICommand>.                                                                                                                   |
| <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.RelativeSource>, <xref:System.Windows.Data.RelativeSource.AncestorType>       | ✔️ | ⚡   | Not nearly as powerful in UWP, relative source only supports `{RelativeSource Self}` and `{RelativeSource TemplatedParent}` as compared to more powerful expressions in WPF like `{RelativeSource PreviousData}` or `{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=PreviousData, AncestorType={x:Type TextBox}}`.                                                                   |
| `StringFormat`                        | ✔️ | ❌   | XAML such as `{Binding DateValue, StringFormat=Date: {0:dddd yyyy-MM-dd}}` isn't supported in UWP and requires custom converters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Styling

| Item                                                                | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <xref:System.Windows.DataTrigger>, [PropertyTrigger](xref:System.Windows.Trigger.Property), <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger> within <xref:System.Windows.Style.Triggers> | ✔️ | ❌   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `VisualStateManager`                           | ⚡  | ✔️  | UWP implementation is a different concept from WPF that takes the place of DataTriggers, this is verbose and more often than not increases complexity compared to data triggers. VisualStateManager in WPF isn't as elegant as in UWP though, for example, it doesn't have the `VisuaStateManager.Setters` property. That means you have to use Storyboards to set your values. |
| Implicit <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate>    | ✔️ | ❌   | Set the `DataType` property of the `DataTemplate` to the corresponding type and the template is then applied automatically to all instances of that particular type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Binding in `Style` setter                      | ✔️ | ❌   | Any type of binding other than `TemplateBinding` isn't support in a template/style within UWP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| BasedOn default Style                          | ✔️ | ⚡   | `BasedOn={StaticResource {x:Type TextBlock}` isn't supported in UWP but works in WPF. Instead, <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Style.BasedOn> requires the use of a key, which is a problem as not all default styles define one. This is a specific example of the missing `x:Type` markup extension in UWP.                                                                                                                                   |

## Classes & objects

This section primarily describes differences in properties at the object or class level. As the number of differences in this section may become large, classes and properties are listed alphabetically and grouped together where it makes sense.

**Grid**

| Item                          | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-----|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BorderBrush`                 | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's Grid. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.                                                                                                         |
| `BorderThickness`             | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's Grid. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.                                                                                                         |
| `ColumnSpacing`, `RowSpacing` | ❌  | ✔️  | Similar to <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.Spacing?displayProperty=nameWithType>, the Grid's ColumnSpacing and RowSpacing properties provide a quick way to set a uniform horizontal and/or vertical distance between all child controls in a Grid. This was added to UWP and doesn't exist in WPF. |
| `CornerRadius`                | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's Grid. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.                                                                                                         |
| `Padding`                     | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's Grid. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.                                                                                                         |
| `ShowGridLines`               | ✔️ | ❌   | While this property exists in WPF, it was only intended for debugging purposes and not production quality code. As such, it was removed from UWP.        |

**StackPanel**

Additional properties such as WPF's `HasLogicalOrientation`, `HorizontalOffset` and `VerticalOffset` are purposely excluded from this section as they aren't considered useful.

| Item                                                                                       | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.AreHorizontalSnapPointsRegular>, <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.AreScrollSnapPointsRegular>, <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.AreVerticalSnapPointsRegular> | ❌  | ✔️  | Information on snapping points doesn't exist in WPF's StackPanel.                                                                                         |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.BackgroundSizing>         | ❌  | ✔️  | See the reference for <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.BackgroundSizing%2A>                                                              |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.BorderBrush>              | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.            |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.BorderThickness>          | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.            |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.CornerRadius>             | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.            |
| `ExtentHeight`             | ✔️ | ❌   | See the reference for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel.ExtentHeight%2A>                                                                |
| `ExtentWidth`              | ✔️ | ❌   | See the reference for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel.ExtentWidth>                                                                 |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.Padding>                  | ❌  | ✔️  | This property doesn't exist in WPF's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. It was added in UWP to help flatten the visual tree instead of requiring the use of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>.            |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.Spacing>                  | ❌  | ✔️  | The <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.StackPanel.Spacing> property is a quick way to set a uniform distance between all child controls in a StackPanel. This was added to UWP and doesn't exist in WPF. |

**UIElement**

| Item                               | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-----|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisibleChanged> event | ✔️ | ❌  | UWP has no way of tracking which controls are actually visible on the display. WPF has the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisibleChanged> event.                                                                                                                             |
| `Visibility.Hidden`                   | ✔️ | ⚡  | UWP doesn't include the `Visibility.Hidden` enum value used for `UIElement.Visibility.Hidden`. In WPF this setting allowed a control to still be used in measure/layout but appear invisible when rendered for display.                                                                                                                                            |
| `Clip`                                | ✔️ | ⚡  | Both WPF and UWP have `UIElement.Clip` properties. However, WPF can take any <xref:System.Windows.Media.GeometryDrawing.Geometry> object allowing for non-rectangular clipping. UWP can only use a <xref:Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.RectangleGeometry> for clipping.                                                                                    |
| <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds>                        | ✔️ | ❌  | In WPF it's possible to clip child contents to the parents bounds by setting <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds> to True. UWP provides this in the extension method <xref:Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.UI.Extensions.UIElementExtensions.ClipToBounds?displayProperty=fullName> provided by the [community toolkit](/windows/communitytoolkit/).                                                                                                                         |
| <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.LayoutTransform>                     | ✔️ | ❌  | <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.LayoutTransform> is needed to transform elements before layout. For example, this allows for easily changing a textbox's direction and then putting it in a table. <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.RenderTransform>, as it applies after layout, doesn't resize parent controls for transformed children. See <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.Transform3D> for the UWP equivalent.                                                |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.Projection>                          | ❌ | ✔️  | A 3D projection applied to the element. When using <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.Projection>, the 3D projection aren't inherited down the XAML tree. Only use this for simple 3D effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.Transform3D>                         | ❌ | ✔️  | Applies a 3D transform matrix to a XAML element and its XAML tree. This lets you create effects where two-dimensional UI appears to exist in 3D space relative to the user. It also supports animations. |

**Minor Changes**

| Item                                              | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Header`, `HeaderTemplate`                           | ❌  | ✔️  | Several controls in UWP support an additional `Header` content and `HeaderTemplate` property. This allows for quickly adding a description or title above a control, which is useful in data-input scenarios. UWP controls with a header property include: <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ComboBox>, DatePicker, ListViewBase, PasswordBox, TextBox, TimePicker, ToggleSwitch. Notably, the header property isn't present on some controls such as: Button and CheckBox.                 |
| ItemsControl. AlternationIndex / AlternationCount | ✔️ | ❌   | WPF has an easy way to change the style of items in a list using ItemsControl.AlternationIndex and ItemsControl.AlternationCount. This allows, for example, to change the background color of a listed item for even/odd entries. UWP doesn't support this at all in any controls. The partial work-around in UWP is to create a new control deriving from the framework's implementation and override the PrepareContainerForItemOverride() method. |
| Thickness                                         | ✔️ | ⚡   | The Thickness structure exposes fields for Top, Bottom, Left and Right instead of dependency properties as in WPF. This means you can't Bind or assign resources to an individual thickness parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Size`, `Rect`, `Point`                               | ✔️ | ✔️  | `Size`, `Rect`, and `Point` are fully supported in both WPF and UWP. However, UWP uses single-precision float types for properties instead of double in WPF. This creates an incompatibility when porting code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Unimplemented Classes**

| Item                                           | WPF | UWP | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Adorner>                                        | ✔️ | ❌   | For more information, see [Adorners overview in WPF](/framework/wpf/controls/adorners-overview?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Supplemental Shapes: Arrow, Callout, Star, etc | ✔️ | ❌   | Several shapes present in WPF are missing in UWP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualBrush>, <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush>                     | ✔️ | ❌   | `VisualBrush` isn't a XAML brush in UWP. Instead, you must fall back to [composition brushes](/windows/uwp/composition/composition-brushes) which are not 1:1 equivalent. <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> isn't supported in UWP.                                                                                                                             |
| <xref:System.Windows.Window>                                         | ✔️ | ❌   | For some good reasons UWP has no concept of a window. This is fine for mobile devices but can be a problem for desktop applications. Without a window, there's no way to control an app's size or position. There are currently proposals to add this in the transition to WinUI 3.0. |

| Sub-pixel anti-aliasing                          | ✔️ | ❌   | Anti-aliasing in UWP along with rendering in general is poor compared to WPF. It's assumed this is for performance reasons on mobile devices and the web (Silverlight).                                               |
| Nested Types in XAML                             | ✔️ | ❌   | Nesting different types in XAML is generally not possible in UWP. Code such as `<ListBox.ItemsSource><`x:Array`><s:string>foo<s/:string><x/:Array>` works in WPF but not in UWP.                                      |
| Event Tunneling / Event Bubbling / Routed Events | ✔️ | ⚡   | A lot more events are simply direct in UWP. Some cases of event bubbling such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click?displayProperty=nameWithType> to parent are not supported in UWP. Event Tunneling, a concept fully supported in WPF, isn't support at all in UWP. |

## Quirks

- Several UWP controls have reentrancy issues. For example, changing the selected item while in a ComboBox SelectionChanged event is largely not possible and will result in a crash. This makes validation directly in the event handler nearly impossible.
- UWP controls are generally not as powerful as the WPF counterparts. For example, for several years the ComboBox in UWP was not editable. The UWP DatePicker also doesn't allow typing in a specific date.
- UWP has no support for data (input) validation. This is a large issue for line-of-business apps migrating from WPF to UWP that heavily use this feature in view models or binding.
- The UWP styling system is different enough from WPF to require extra effort during porting. UWP uses the VistualStateManger instead of concepts like DataTriggers or EventTriggers from WPF. Styling/Templating are one of the main differences.
- The ResourceDictionary XAML markup in UWP supports far fewer features than in WPF.
- UWP seems to follow only the XAML/2006 spec instead of [XAML/2009](xaml-2009-language-features.md) supported by WPF
- Several UWP controls are sealed and new controls can't derive from them
- For advanced rendering, UWP has fewer features built in. This requires falling back to Win2D or composition more often.
- There are several namespaces differences in UWP and WPF. For example, WPF has System.Windows.Media.Colors while UWP moves this to Windows.UI.Colors.
- TextBlock and TextBox, for example, do not allow 'null' values for string-type Text properties. Setting null to `Text` will crash the app at runtime. This is one of the largest concerns when porting over from WPF as WPF accepts null without an issue; yet the same code may crash in UWP. The solution is to use `.Text = stringValue ?? string.Empty;` for all controls instead of setting a string directly.
- In WPF it was possible to build templates using the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElementFactory> without using XAML. This allowed for entire UI's to be created without markup (since instantiating controls is already possible in C# directly). However, the burden of maintaining two different ways of doing things became too much and Microsoft dropped this ability in UWP and deprecated it for WPF. Instead, it's necessary to write template XAML as a string in code then pass it to XamlReader.Load().

## Controls

This <xref:System.Windows.Controls.section> describes the differences in controls in vanilla WPF and UWP (with the WinUI 2.x library). It excludes some primitives and shapes (Ellipse, Rect, etc.)
